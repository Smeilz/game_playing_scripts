## tictactoe_q.py

Uses tabular Q-Learning to learn optimal play of Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses), purely
through exploratory self-play, with reward +1 for a win, and -1 for a loss.

It takes a little over 30,000 example games before the agent learns how to play optimally, resulting in
draws in all self-play.
